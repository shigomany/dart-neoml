## <a id='about'>About</a>

This package will help you easily create and train and use machine learning and neural network models in the Dart language based on the [NeoML](https://github.com/neoml-lib/neoml) framework


## <a id='motivation'>Motivation</a>

Among the neural network and machine learning libraries on dart that worked with C++ under the hood. Since C++ achieves high performance, with [dart-ffi](https://dart.dev/guides/libraries/c-interop) this can be achieved on the basis of the NeoML end-to-end framework.

### <a id='choose-strategy'>Why was NeoML chosen?</a>

- __Cross-platform__ framework that works on all known platforms Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS (which have been fully supported since [Flutter 3.0.0](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/tools/sdk/release-notes/release-notes-3.0.0)).
- __High performance__. This was discussed by NeoML in an article on [Habr](https://habr.com/ru/company/abbyy/blog/506808/).
- __Usabillity for mobile__. It is possible to [serialize](https://github.com/neoml-lib/neoml#serialization-format) the trained model and use it on your mobile devices.
- __Backend__. Machine learning models are also used on the backend, where Dart also takes its place (for example, [AppWrite](https://appwrite.io/)). In the same [Django framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/), you can also use machine learning models, since Python is a favorable environment for this.

But before you start, you need to deploy the project locally.

To do this, you need to follow a number of steps:

1. Clone project with submodules:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 https://github.com/shigomany/dart-neoml.git
```

2. If you have already cloned the repository, you must run this command to clone the submodules.
   
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
